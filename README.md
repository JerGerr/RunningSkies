 clear skies ahead, start running

    I would like to build an Air Quality Application. 

    The motivation for this is a simple one and quite personal: I am  asthmatic but like to do outdoor sports too. The high energy prices will probably mean that people tend to put on their fire places more quicky The weather is very humid at the moment, which means that the chimney smoke will linger much closer to ground level and thus will directly affect the airways of people like me.

    I have been using similar apps and it will be nice and a fun challenge to build one myself.

Technologies
    Expo
    React Native

    Openweathermap.org's Air Pollution API
    Cities.json     for location search

    React Navigation
    React-Native-Dropdown-Picker
    React Native Progress Circle (to be implemented)
    React-Native-Vector-Icons

    Colapsible list elements

Plans
    The idea is a visual dynamic element (a dial, progressbar) to show the air quality status.
    Improved location search (adding spots in Hki)
    MyLocation (be able to use own location)
    Map use, map search

    This will aÂ´mean addednavigation
